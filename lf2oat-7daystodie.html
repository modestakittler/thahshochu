                            <p> It has been a long year but the end of 2018 is now upon us. We've had our humble community grow from just over 29k users to almost 38k! You've all made thousands of posts, comments and over 6.1m page views (You can stop refreshing now, A17e is out now lol). Before we move onto the new year though we thought it would be fun to participate in this years Bestof Awards (https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2018/comments/a335bd/its_time_to_kick_off_the_best_of_awards_for_2018/) So I was just eating cornbread due to being about to starve and checked my player info using the B hotkey and realised something: As long as you eat the food then go into player info menu, it doesn't consume the food in the process of eating and you can make it last forever. (I haven't tested this with any other food / menu) Edit: works with pretty much every in-game menu it seems. Are you tired of surviving alone? Ever wish you had a friend help you through horde nights? Have you ever been so lonely you spawned and placed a zombie corpse in your base to keep you company(You know who you are!)? If so, you've come to the right place. By posting here you can find friends to play and survive with! Remember, you don't need to be faster than the zombies just faster than your friends ;) Please leave your Steam/XB1/PSN name, what time zone you're in and works We don't have a PC to play, haha. We used to play on PS4, but haven't had that for a couple years now. I think we're on Day 47 and having a blast! It was never fun to play single player, so it's pretty much that special game we play together on our weekends or if we don't have to work a morning shift the next day. It's honestly every bit as fun as I remember it and since it's been a few years since we've last played, and now on a different console, it feels shinier and newer Exploiting a Glitch amp#x200B; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCAmdX-B4Bwampfeature=youtu.be (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCAmdX-B4Bwampfeature=youtu.be). So I have the game for pc and enjoy it quite a lot. But now as a friend is here I am thinking about getting it for PS4 just to play with him. Is it worth. Looking for advice or help on where to start with modding for 7 Days to Die? Are you having trouble finding a particular mod, or opinions of what mod to play next?

So I've played this game on PC. I love it. My friends don't have a pic so we wanted to play on console. This is not a debate of whether one is better then the other, because no offense, PC is always gonna be better for a game when it starts on PC and is ported to console. I want to know the difference between the two. Does the console still have levels and perks? Are vehicles the same? What differences are there and is it worth playing in the console? We will be playing Used to like this game but a recent update pushed it onto an always-online model. Went there to ask if there was a way to actually be completely offline rather than some workaround which still leaves the game trying to connect to the internet and mess around there and was promptly told I must be a conspiracy theorist with a shit computer for possibly wanting to keep my games offline. Can't really comment on the game these days but it seems the community aren't all that great. 
I've played this game for a long time on xbox and recently was given a gaming pc. I have an i5 8th gen. And a 1060 graphics card. The game is unplayable on the lowest settings. The game is so clunky and laggy I can't do anything. Any suggestions on quick fixes.
