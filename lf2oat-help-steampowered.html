photo photo Новое дополнение доказало, что Скайрим для нордов. Соответственно и "Официальная ККИ по Skyrim" тоже). This is insanity. I've been trying for over an hour to find a way to submit a support ticket in Steam. None of their self-help links in https://help.steampowered.com/en/ even come close to answering my question, and I can find literally no way to even begin submitting an actual ticket for support. I'm not looking for help with my issue here, all I want to know is how to navigate their terrible self-help site in order to actually submit a personalized ticket instead of being linked As the title says, I forgot to add a game I was interested in to my wishlist. Is there anyway I guess a new steamVR update was released today. Got home from work wanted to play some VR and not a single game I have will open. I’ve verified integrity of each one I tried. Also reinstalled them. Integrity of steamvr and tried the beta(it’s same as live version) to no avail. Anyone i need help because i found an old hard drive and in the user data iv'e got some steam id's of my old account's and i would like to recover them Anyone  Help i have done everything it doesnt connect.
