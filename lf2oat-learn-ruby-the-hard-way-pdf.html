Hello fellow theorists. This is actually my first time posting on this subreddit, though I have been lurking (and of course watching on YT) for a while. But I wanted to share some thoughts on a thing that gave me headaches even when I was a little kid, starting to game: Pokémon Economics .

This post is for /u/OutlawPaul who request more information about the secret Plexus groups on FB. Be warned, I write lengthy posts. :) (I tried to make more line breaks between the paragraphs, but failed.) First, I want to thank everybody for their kind words and support on my first post about escaping MLM life. I've decided to make a series of posts about Plexus, in the hope it will help someone else. :) I talked about being automatically being assigned. One of my friends recently started taking a course in full-stack web development, and was asking for my advice since I similarly took the "self-taught" route to becoming a full-time programmer. After chatting about things I'm glad I had done and things I wish I had done differently, I sent him this email detailing a list of resources I had found useful over the course of my self-education these past few years. Having benefited from this subreddit in the past (nearly 4 years ago), I thought. Hi everyone, I recently published an in-depth video on how to create a great job description in seven steps (https://youtu.be/8AVOu9jUduA?utm_source=mjg_redent). It includes how to write a role's responsibilities, qualifications, compensation, logistics, title, and company summary. Below is a transcript. (In the video, Office Space and the Pied Piper logo make cameos. :)) I'll be around to answer any questions here or by email ( mark@venturekit.com (mailto:mark@venturekit.com)).

I'm copletely new to the backend! But I still use Node.js. Er. Am I doing fine? Is my method correct? Am I missing something important? You're the experts! Please let me know! >But I'd recommend learning the backend concepts first. MDN is your best friend I'm really new to the backend, but since Hi, on reddit.com/r/linux i noticed several people in the last months asked what one could do to improve opensource, or what one hates about FLOSS. So i sat down and wrote a couple of things down, which should/could be improved. some should not perhaps, but alas, my company would like to have it. Disclaimer: I work with mostly FLOSS-components, so i know everything a little bit, but most of it not very good. If sth. is already done, i missed it. But i do not think that i missed much. Hi, this guide was made towards users to which to learn programming but don't know where to start. Some tips - Find some open source projects and contribute to them. - The process is slow but you should never stop. - Find some small problem or annoyance with your pc, try to make a program to automate that boring process. - Don't just follow tutorials, practice, do homework and learn why you do a certain thing mentioned in tutorials, what each line of code does. - Google

After a little research and asking around I learned that Ruby and Python were good beginner languages. Digging deeper still I learned that Python was common on Linux systems (already a fan of the open source philosophy and running dual boot Linux/Windows on my laptop) and was often used in science and engineering. Cool, I think I'll learn Python since I'm already a Linux/STEM kind of guy. If I need to I can always. Introduction: Hi, I’m Locke.

Codility is looking to improve the way of hiring programmers so that instead of spending most of their time interviewing the wrong candidates, programmers can focus on what they do best – create software. We create programming tests that automatically assess the quality of the solutions. This is a powerful way for programmers to demonstrate their skills and for companies to test the fundamental competences of programmers being recruited.
