The workroom lights gradually winked on, bringing the workroom to life for yet another season of RuPaul's Drag Race. However, this time, things looked a little.\ different.\ The workroom walls weren't their usual pink, but mostly gray with stripes of orange, yellow and green in different corners. The "Drag Race" logo was placed on a wall as a white appliqué. There were mannequins at every table, and the lights cast a dim yellow glow on the empty room. It was the original workroom of Season. The mood in the workroom was surprisingly upbeat as the queens put together the finishing touches of their outfits. Bebe was calmly piecing together a dress made of torn loofahs while Chi Chi created a headpiece for her garbage bag couture. Thorgy seemed surprised with Chi Chi’s work. “That looks fabulous, girl.” Thorgy mused as she ran multicolored bath towels under a sowing machine. Chi Chi turned and smiled. “Thank you! I’m a lil nervous, but I think its a pretty dress the judges I have two iFrames in every page of my HTML site at the moment. I would like the height of the iFrame to adjust according to the screen size. I would like the bottom of the iFrames to follow down to the bottom of screen (ABOVE THE FOOTER NAVBAR) to ensure the site is rendered across all screen resolutions and the iFrame heights fit. I have tried to set min-widths to the iFrames frameMain and #newsMyEd but that does not still seem to work. You can see how the bottom of the iFrames #newsMyEd. After the elimination, the queens were all dancing erratically onstage to “Snapshot”. Chi Chi was going in , channeling her anxiety from lipsyncing into mopping the floor with her cucina. Trixie has a false smile plastered on her face as she mock danced, and Shangela and DeLa boogied. Abruptly, RuPaul stood up and called for the music to stop. The queens looked at her in awe, obviously confused. AJA : We’re all just awkwardly standing here as Ru burns holes into the back of the fuckin. Shangela, DeLa, Morgan and Thorgy all prepared for the runway together on Elimination Day. Morgan seemed agitated, her hands shaky as she applied her eyeshadow. Shangela noticed this immediately and brought it up. "Morgan, what's going on?" "Well," Morgan began, pausing to take a long swig of water, "You know how hosting is pretty much my.my thing?" "Yeah, you're always doing shows in WeHo." Shangela answered coolly. "Well, I bombed this week. Like, hardcore. I screwed As "Supermodel" faded out and Kennedy Davenport & Shangela pulled themselves off the ground, the queens at the back of the stage grew apprehensive. DeLa squeezed a nervous Chi Chi's shoulder, and Aja looked absolutely shellshocked. Trixie and Bebe were quietly chattering, and Morgan was staring at the stage floor. CHI CHI: Two of my best friends in this competition are the Bottom 2 and I don't want to see either go. I'm afraid for Kennedy. Is Ru gonna let her stay again after 
"Ladies, I have made my decision." Ru said solemnly. Kennedy and Chi Chi looked close to tears as they straightened themselves out post lipsync. Neither contestant looked ready to be eliminated or to watch their friend be eliminated. KENNEDY : This is just.this is your worst nightmare going into the competition. You don't want to have to eliminate your friend or go home in their place. My heart hurts. " Chi Chi Devayne, shantay you stay. You may join the other girls." RuPaul announce. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, we are in the Supersonic Class now which means we will be going even faster than before, and moreso in this event, since it's a Peace Keeper event, which means no weapons, but this doesn't mean there won't be any exciting action. We have to use our ability and knowledge of the tracks in order for success here https://youtu.be/lBOpFSFuyDE playthrough The lip-sync was much tighter than everyone in the room expected. Morgan knew every single lyric, bending and twisting sensually to the song before performing a perfect barrel roll upon the final chorus. Chi Chi high kicked multiple times and churned out multiple stunts without breaking a sweat, delivering the lyrics with a burning intensity. SHANGELA: I am so thankful I am not RuPaul. There's no way I could figure out who did better. The song ended, and Troye & Ariana hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re\-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, Mark IV hits the midway point of the event, and there are still races to go with different races types, all ones that we have seen before. Let's hope that there aren't any Peace Keepers and hope for more Fall Out and Endurance events, which is what our strong suit has been so far https://youtu.be/pNiR\-Cf\_zdY playthrough to this point: https://www.youtu. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, we get to partake in what personally is my favorite event in the game, which is the destruction event. You all know me, I love destroying bikes in this game, and this event rewards us for doing so. Mark IV likes destruction as well, so this event fits both of us very well, so let's get trigger happy here https://youtu.be/SAn05SBsRM0 playthrough The girls were loud and obnoxious in the workroom. Kennedy and Chi Chi were laughing maniacally at the mirrors while Aja and Shangela were trying on each other's wigs. Trixie's unmistakable witch-cackle couldn't be missed as she, Milk and Thorgy got prepared for the main stage. However, Morgan, Bebe and DeLa were all noticeably quieter than their competitors, with Morgan and DeLa talking in hushed voices. "Look, I.I don't want to look like I can't take the pressure, because I can. However 
hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, it feels like we were racing through bad weather not too long about, but another bad weather challenge is soon upon us, so once more, we'll have to brave the elements as well as the other riders if we're to not only complete our contracts, but also to get first place. Got a lot on our slate today, so let's go get it done https://youtu.be/qrVT_hbI8yY playth. "Ladies, I have made my decision." Thorgy and Milk both stared intensely at Ru. Milk had given a wild and whimsical lip-sync, while Thorgy had camped it up and done a hand stand. Ru had laughed at Thorgy's moves, which Milk had wonkily mimicked. The two queens were visibly tired. TRIXIE: I hate to be that girl, but its not like its difficult to tell who won that lip-sync at all. " Thorgy Thor, shantay you stay. You may leave the stage." "Thank you so much, Ru." Thorgy called nervo. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the final edition of my re\-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. On today's finale, it is the final part of the XGRA Global event and like the races prior in this event, it will be different race types that we have clashed with before, and the last races are going to be no different, along with us hoping that there isn't a Peace Keeper in sight. Let's go get that championship, Mark IV and finish the 2080 XGRA season in style. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today is going to test Mark IV's staying power, because today is an endurance challenge, which means are an extended number of laps, but a good trade off is that we get more time to destroy the other's bikes, and you all know how much me and Mark IV love blowing up the other bikes, so this event is a good fit for us https://youtu.be/Tz5d4IiHSVI playthrough hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, we aren't going to be able to use our weapons since it's a pure racing event, but that doesn't mean that the racing will be boring. The good news is that the bikes will be carrying a lot less weight since we won't be hauling weapons around, and that means the trade off is that we gain speed, but our racing lines become more important, as does knowing 
hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re\-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, we begin the final event of the 2080 XGRA season, and that is the XGRA Global event, which is an event that is a hodgepodge of events that we have undertaken already. We won't know which event we are racing in until it begins, and to make things more exciting, we are now able to hit Ultrasonic speeds, so buckle up and let's try and win that championship. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, we start the events in the Sonic class and we also chose to stay loyal to Terranova. Loyalty to your first team seems like a foreign concept these days in the real sports world. Anyway, we start things off with a burn off event, which means reduced laps but increased pressure. It's on https://youtu.be/RwAcrcT7RGo playthrough to this point: https://www.yout. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, it is the final event of the Supersonic Class, and this one is a fan favorite\(not mine\), and it's an Extreme Weather challenge, which means we have to brave the elements as well as the other riders, along with getting our contracts completed. Looks like we have a lot of work ahead of us, but let's do it with a smile on our face https://youtu.be/MEY9Rq19hNY playthrough. hello everyone, DarkKirby14 here and with me here today is the next edition of my re-run through XGRA: Extreme G Racing Association. Today, it is time for another destruction derby, which is the event that me and Mark IV love the most, as we get rewarded even more for destroying bikes, and we aren't just talking contracts here. We got the other riders in our cross hairs, and we have many death strikes on stand by. This is gonna get explosive https://youtu.be/84k_QxzESfA playthrough Have a TV tuner or a video capture card installed on your Windows 2000 or XP system?
